# Google Sheets + Steampipe

[Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about) is an online spreadsheet app that lets you create and format spreadsheets and work with other people.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

Query all the sheets in your spreadsheet:

```sql
select
  title
from
  googlesheets_sheet;
```

```
+-----------+
| title     |
+-----------+
| Marks     |
| Students  |
| Dashboard |
| Books     |
| Employees |
+-----------+
```

Query cell values for a given sheet:

```sql
select
  cell,
  value
from
  googlesheets_cell
where
  sheet_name = 'Students';
```

```
+------+--------------+
| cell | value        |
+------+--------------+
| A1   | Student Name |
| A2   | Alexandra    |
| A3   | Andrew       |
| A4   | Anna         |
| A5   | Becky        |
| B1   | ID           |
| B2   | 1            |
| B3   | 2            |
| B4   | 3            |
| B5   | 4            |
+------|--------------+
```

- **[Table definitions & examples â†’](/plugins/turbot/googlesheets/tables)**

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest Google Sheets plugin:

```shell
steampipe plugin install googlesheets
```

### Credentials

| Item        | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| APIs | 1. Create or select a project. <br/> 2. Visit the [API dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard). <br/> 3. Click `Enable APIs and Services`. <br/> 4. Search for `drive`. <br/> 5. Select `Google Drive API`. <br/> 6. Click `Enable` to allow your project to use the Google Drive API. 
| Credentials | 1. To use **OAuth client**, configure your [credentials](#authenticate-using-oauth-client).<br />2. To use **domain-wide delegation**, generate your [service account and credentials](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation#create_the_service_account_and_credentials) and [delegate domain-wide authority to your service account](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation#delegate_domain-wide_authority_to_your_service_account). Use `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` OAuth 2.0 scope, so that the service account can access Google Sheet service. |
| Radius      | Each connection represents a single Google spreadsheet. |
| Resolution  | 1. Credentials from the JSON file specified by the `token_path` parameter in your Steampipe config.<br />2. Credentials from the default json file location (`~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`).<br />3. Credentials from the JSON file specified by the `credentials` parameter in your Steampipe config. |

### Configuration

Installing the latest googlesheets plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/googlesheets.spc`) with a single connection named `googlesheets`:

```hcl
connection "googlesheets" {
  plugin = "googlesheets"

  # The spreadsheet ID can be found in the spreadsheet's URL, e.g., https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11iXfj-RHpFsil7_hNK-oQjCqmBLlDfCvju2AOF-ieb4
  # spreadsheet_id = "11iXfj-RHpFsil7_hNK-oQjCqmBLlDfCvju2AOF-ieb4"

  # If no sheets are specified, then all sheets will be retrieved
  # sheets = ["Dashboard", "Students", "Books", "Marks", "Employees"]

  # You may connect to Google Sheet using more than one option:

  # 1. To authenticate using OAuth 2.0, specify a client secret file
  # `token_path` - The path to a JSON credential file that contains Google application credentials. 
  # If `token_path` is not specified in a connection, credentials will be loaded from:
  #   - The path specified in the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, if set; otherwise
  #   - The standard location (`~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`)
  # token_path = "/Users/myuser/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json"

  # 2. To authenticate using domain-wide delegation, specify a service account credential file and the user email for impersonation
  # `credentials` - Either the path to a JSON credential file that contains Google application credentials, or the contents of a service account key file in JSON format.
  # credentials = "/path/to/my/creds.json"

  # `impersonated_user_email` - The email (string) of the user which should be impersonated. Needs permissions to access the Admin APIs.
  # impersonated_user_email = "username@domain.com"
}
```

The default values for the `spreadsheet_id` and `sheets` arguments are
configured to be used with our [Google Sheets Plugin - Sample School
Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11iXfj-RHpFsil7_hNK-oQjCqmBLlDfCvju2AOF-ieb4)
spreadsheet, which is a public spreadsheet maintained by the Steampipe team.
All of our examples in this document, and in our table documents, are based on
this sample spreadsheet.

## Advanced configuration options

### Authenticate using OAuth client

You can use client secret credentials to protect the user's data by only granting tokens to authorized requestors. Use following steps to configure credentials:

- [Configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#configure_the_oauth_consent_screen).
- [Create an OAuth client ID credential](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_a_oauth_client_id_credential) with the application type `Desktop app`, and download the client secret JSON file.
- Wherever you have the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed, run the following command with the correct client secret JSON file parameters:

  ```sh
  gcloud auth application-default login \
    --client-id-file=client_secret.json \
    --scopes="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly"
  ```

- In the browser window that just opened, authenticate as the user you would like to make the API calls through.
- Review the output for the location of the **Application Default Credentials** file, which usually appears following the text `Credentials saved to file:`.
- Set the **Application Default Credentials** filepath in the Steampipe config `token_path` or in the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
